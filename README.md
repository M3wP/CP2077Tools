Tools for CP2077


Just quickly until I can put something decent here.

I have fixed a few issues in the Pascal bnkextr tool.  This tool (any source version) isn't working correctly at this time.

I have made a tool to dump meta data from WAV/WEM files called wavdatdmp
	Usage:  wavdatdmp <infile>

I have made a tool to append a RIFF/WAVEfmt header to a raw file called raw2wav
	Usage: raw2wav <infile>

Enjoy.

Daniel.
